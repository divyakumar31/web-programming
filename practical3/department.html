        <p>Computer engineering is the fastest developing discipline in the world. It integrates several fields of
            electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer
            engineers embed computers in other machines and systems, build networks to transfer data and develop ways to
            make computers, faster, smaller and more capable. The major technical areas of Computer Engineering are :
            Cybersecurity, Networking, Database Handling, Artificial Intelligence, Design Automation, Computer software,
            Embedded Systems.

            Computer Engineers venture into various fields such as web-development, Computer Support Specialist,
            Computer Systems Analyst ,Computer Systems Designer, Database Administrator, Network Administrator and much
            more. Future opportunities in this field are beyond boundaries. Computer Engineering Department in L.D.C.E
            covers a wide spectrum of topics in data communication, computer networking, operating systems,
            microprocessor programming and applications, parallel processing, compiler design, system programming,
            software engineering, simulation and modeling, distributed systems, graphics and image processing, various
            packages and softwares like ORACLE, JAVA, VC++ etc.</p> -->
